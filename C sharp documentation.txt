The Proposal
To achieve good grades in your proposal for a digital solution intended for any given
scenario, you need to focus on several key components as outlined below. Here’s what you
should complete to meet the grading criteria:
1. Proposal Overview:
●​ Your proposal should outline a digital solution that addresses the specific needs of
the scenario you are working with, focusing on key objectives such as interactive
resources, supporting assessment and monitoring, and promoting collaboration.
2. Key Requirements of the Brief:
●​ Ensure your proposal addresses the following key requirements relevant to your
scenario for example:
○​ Interactive teaching and learning resources
○​ Encouragement of wider learning
○​ Support for assessment and monitoring
○​ Collaborative tools for teaching and learning
○​ Accessibility features for a diverse user base
○​ A reward system for learning
○​ Elements of gamified learning
3. Data Handling:
●​ Explain how your solution will handle data and facilitate communication between the
back end and front end. This should include:
○​ Managing appointments or bookings (if applicable)
○​ Storing and using data for customised solutions
○​ Supporting digital content delivery across various platforms/devices
○​ Catering to different strategies for learning through diverse content (e.g.,
audio, video, text, AR)
○​ Implementing gamified learning approaches
○​ Providing accessibility features (e.g., resizable fonts, selectable colour
schemes, referencing relevant standards)
○​ Incorporating social learning through integration with social media APIs or
developing a website that utilises a back-end database.
4. Risk Management:
●​ Identify relevant risks and explain how you will mitigate them. Consider:
○​ Malicious or inappropriate use (e.g., data input validation)
○​ Data breaches (e.g., use of SSL/Encryption/HTTPS)
○​ Cross-site scripting (e.g., content security policies/data input validation)
○​ SQL injection (e.g., sanitising data input)
5. Wider Issues:

●​ Your rationale should address wider issues, including:
○​ General issues such as privacy and potential user errors
○​ Specific issues relevant to your scenario (e.g., age restrictions, intellectual
property concerns, ensuring users are at the appropriate ability level)
○​ Technical issues and guidelines that are relevant to software development
and the industrial context
○​ Laws, legislations & regulations that need to be adhered to
6. Current Practices and Emerging Technology:
●​ Discuss how your proposal is relevant to current practices and emerging
technologies in your field, such as:
○​ Apps and mobile devices
○​ Video or remote instruction
○​ Use of AR/VR technologies
7. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
●​ Include details of the functional and non-functional requirements, key performance
indicators, and user acceptance criteria that could be used to judge the success of
the solution you will implement. These should be tailored to effectively meet the
needs of the given scenario.
Assessment Focus:​
Grades are categorised into bands based on the effectiveness of your proposal:
●​ Band 0 (0 points): No rewardable material.
●​ Band 1 (1-3 points): Identifies some problems and offers basic decomposition;
meets some needs and mitigates some risks.
●​ Band 2 (4-6 points): Identifies most problems and effectively decomposes them;
meets most needs and mitigates most risks.
●​ Band 3 (7-9 points): Fully identifies and effectively decomposes problems; meets
the full needs, mitigates potential risks, and addresses relevant regulatory guidelines
and legal requirements.
By focusing on these elements, you can create a comprehensive proposal that meets the
expectations of the assessment criteria and effectively addresses the needs of any given
scenario.
